# redux-multiple-states-nextjs
A prototype built with React, Redux, and NextJS (for routing) that shows how one can do CRUD to multiple state trees within a single webapp. Uses fast-redux, now you don't need to use constants for action types to match actions with reducers, as compared to conventional redux.
